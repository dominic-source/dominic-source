# Hi, I'm Chinonso Morba

I'm a passionate software engineer with a strong foundation in web development and a burning desire to excel in the field. Currently, I'm a software engineering student at the renowned ALX Holberton Software Engineering Program, where I'm continuously expanding my knowledge and honing my skills.

## Projects

I've had the privilege to work on several projects that have allowed me to apply my skills and demonstrate my problem-solving abilities. Some notable ones include:
- [ProvisonsPall](https://www.cadaservices.tech/market):
  A business Application to help business owners connect to their clients and vice versa. It was built on Jquery, Javascript, CSS, HTML, Python, Flask, and SQLAlchemy. And I deployed it myself on these architectures: Nginx, Haproxy (load balancer), and a live server. I collaborated with two other persons on this project and I was the major contributor as I built the API endpoints, and Web routes, designed the dashboard using Jquery, HTML, and CSS, integrated Google map API, contributed to code reviews, and connected the application.
- [Static web application](https://cadatech-portfolio.vercel.app/): A web application developed using Next.js, Javascript, and Node.js, demonstrating my proficiency in frontend technology design.
